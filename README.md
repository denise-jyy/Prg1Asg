# Prg1 Assignment


##Undead creatures are attacking the city! Position your units to protect the city until
you have killed enough of the creatures to drive them off.<br>
In this “tower defence” strategy game, monsters are advancing on the city from right
to left across 5 lanes. To kill the monsters, you have to purchase units and place them
on the field of battle so that they can shoot or block the monsters. However, you start
with 10 gold and only get 1 gold per turn, so spend your precious resources wisely!<br>
##There are two types of monsters:
-Zombies (ZOMBI) start with 15 hit points, deal 3-6 damage and move 1 square
each turn. They initially give 2 gold as a reward when killed.
-Werewolves (WWOLF) start with 10 hit points, deal 1-4 damage and move 2
squares each turn. They initially give 3 gold as a reward when killed.
##Players can purchase two types of “defender” units:
-Archers (ARCHR) start with 5 hit points. Each turn, they will shoot an arrow down
their lane from left to right, dealing 1-4 damage to the first monster it hits. They
cost 5 gold to purchase.
-Walls (WALL) start with 20 hit points. They do not deal any damage and serve to
block and slow down the monsters. They cost 3 gold to purchase.
Units purchased by the players can only be placed in the first 3 columns of the field.
